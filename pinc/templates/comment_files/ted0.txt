<p>Please retain page references (such as "see page number x", or the page numbers
in the Table of Contents or Index), not actual page numbers at the top or
bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Please make a HTML edition, including any illustrations, if any.</p>
<p><b>Formatting is important; please format TOCs, lists of Illustrations,
etc., correctly.</b></p>
<p>Please note any problems, observations, complains, request
for guidance etc., in the project forum thread. There, we will reach
consensus and make a decision.</p>
<p>I apologize in advance for any missing pages or other difficulties.
If you encounter such, please post to the Missing Pages Wiki as well as making
a note in the appropriate forum.</p>
