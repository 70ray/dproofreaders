<p>The 48th BAE report is a general index of the first 47 reports.
The series continued later, without the accompanying papers. This is
part of the subject index.</p>

<p>You will find larger, uncropped images

<p>BAE-specific information is collected in the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/BAE/Formatting#Proofing">BAE Proofreading Wiki</a>.
For everything else, refer to the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/proofreading_guidelines.php">Proofreading
Guidelines</a> and <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Formatting
Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p>Please proofread the 3 different types of apostrophes using this markup.</p>
<p>
'   = normal apostrophe, printed ’ (curls to left = single close quote)<br>
`   = backwards apostrophe, printed ‛ (curls to right, similar to single open quote)<br>
['] = simple line showing pronunciation, printed ' or ´
</p>
<p>For example, the word<br>
<img src = "http://www.pgdp.net/w/images/7/73/Apostrophe_word.png"><br>
would be proofread as</p>
<pre>Ä[']-t'a`ka[']-i</pre>

<p><b>Asterisks:</b> Pages in the range <b>17: 129–344</b> (Volume
17, pages 129–344) appear both with and without an asterisk, thanks
to a glitch in page numbering of that volume. Please proofread and format
the asterisk as printed, with no extra markup.</p>
