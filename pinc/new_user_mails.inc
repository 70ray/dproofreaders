The following documents are useful to new volunteers as an introduction
to general and specific aspects of ebook production at $site_abbreviation:

Overview (on the main page):
  $site_url
Basic site/proofreading questions (Beginners' FAQ):

Most volunteers participate at $site_abbreviation by proofreading. However, there are
many other ways to contribute, including Smooth Reading and Post Processing.
For more detailed information on these and other phases of ebook production
at $site_abbreviation, please visit the main help page (FAQ Central) at:

Once you understand more about the work being done, the best thing to
do is get started! Each project (book) on the site goes through multiple
rounds of proofreading. When you first start, you will only be working
on the books in the first round (\"{$ELR_round->id}\"). Other rounds will become
available as you gain experience and time on site.

Here's a step-by-step process for proofreading:

- When you log in you are taken to the Activity Hub.

- Scroll down and follow the \"{$ELR_round->name}\" link, or
  click the \"{$ELR_round->id}\" link on the navigation bar. 

- Scroll down to see a listing of available books. When you see one
  that interests you, click on the title to open its Project Page.

- The Project Page shows basic information on a project as well as
  \"Project Comments\" from the Project Manager. Please read these
  carefully. Any special instructions there take precedence over the
  general guidelines and may direct you to mark up additional items,
  but apply _only_ to that specific project.

- Click the \"Start Proofreading\" link near the bottom of the page.

- You are now proofreading! Compare the text in the text box to what
  is in the image, making corrections for differences between the two.

- If you need to refer to the Project Comments again, you can pull them
  up by clicking on the link below the text box.

- Once you are finished with the page, click on either \"Save as 'Done'\"
  or \"Save as 'Done' & Proofread Next Page\"

You have now proofread your first page! Congratulations!


Here are some brief answers to common questions:

Q: What books should I start on?

A: Anything which catches your interest, but we initially recommend
   projects marked BEGINNERS ONLY, which are given close attention
   by experienced proofreaders who will send you personal feedback.

Q: What should I work on next?

A: After BEGINNERS ONLY material, you might try projects marked EASY,
   but again, don't be afraid to try anything that interests you. If
   you find yourself uncomfortable with working on a particular page,
   you can always press the \"Return Page to Round\" button and let
   someone else tackle it.

Q: How do I know if I'm doing OK?

A: If you work on a BEGINNERS ONLY project, you _will_ receive personal
   feedback. For other projects, you will generally not get feedback, but
   you can always post a message in the project forum thread mentioning
   which page(s) you worked on and ask someone to take a look.

Q: I'm not sure how to use the interface.

A: Proofreading interface help is available by clicking the \"?\" button
   near the lower right corner.

Q: I'm not sure how something should be marked.

A: For general questions, please refer to the Proofreading Guidelines.

   For questions about a specific page/project, post in the project's
   forum thread by following the link labeled \"Discuss this project\" on
   the Project Page. Each project has its own discussion thread; you can
   post a question or message via the \"Reply\" button. Even if you don't
   have a specific question, it's worth reading through the discussion
   to see what other volunteers have observed or encountered.

   You may also leave a note to later volunteers in the text itself by
   marking it like this: [**your note here]


Every page you work on helps us make these books available more rapidly.
We hope that you will enjoy volunteering at $site_abbreviation, and appreciate your
contribution towards our effort to provide an ever larger and richer
collection of free quality ebooks to the world!

Thanks,

The $site_name Team
