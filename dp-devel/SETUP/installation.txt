Here's a first stab at installation instructions for the Distributed
Proofreaders website code. This assumes you're installing from scratch.
If you're upgrading from a previous version, things would be different ...

--- Install PHP (if it isn't already).
        You should have GD and YAZ support.
        GD is required for jpgraph.
        YAZ is optional for the project creation code.

--- Install aspell (if it isn't already).
        The code uses aspell for the spellchecker in the proofreading interface.
        Note that for aspell 0.50 you may have to symlink the .dat files due to
        some filename inconsistencies. For example, iso8859-1.dat should have a
        symlink iso-8859-1.dat pointing to it, and similar for all other dictionaries.
        You might not need to do this if you are using aspell 0.60 or higher.
        You need aspell 0.60 if you want to support UTF-8.
    
--- Install MySQL (if it isn't already).
        In the examples in this document, we will assume it's on "localhost",
        i.e. the same host on which you are running these commands, and the
        same host that runs the webserver.

--- Choose names for various MySQL items:
        --- the DP database (to house the DP data);
        --- the DP user (to handle all DP queries);
        --- the DP user's password.
    Don't pick a password that contains an apostrophe (single-quote),
    as it confuses the code.
    In the examples in this document, we will use
        dp_db
        dp_user
        dp_password
    for these three items. You may wish to choose names that are harder for
    others to guess (especially for the password!).

--- Set up MySQL to create the database and user:
        There are various ways to do each of these.
        We'll show how to do it using the mysql client.

    --- Connect to the MySQL server as the root user, or any sufficiently
        powerful user.
            mysql -h localhost -u root -p

    --- Create the database.
            CREATE DATABASE dp_db;
        If you have MySQL 4.1.1 or higher:
            CREATE DATABASE dp_db CHARACTER SET UTF8;
        Note that you can have UTF-8 enabled on the site even if you have older
        MySQL version which doesn't support it.

    --- Create the user.
        (See MySQL Manual 5.5.4 Adding New Users to MySQL.)
            GRANT ALL  ON dp_db.* TO dp_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dp_password';
            GRANT FILE ON *.*     TO dp_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dp_password';
   
    --- Exit from the mysql client.
            quit;

--- Install and configure phpBB.
        phpBB2 is most easily installed in your document root as phpbb2/
        In .../phpBB2/config.php, set db vars with values chosen above.

--- Create phpBB forum categories and forums.

    (pourlean to fill in more details)

    Currently, Distributed Proofreaders is set up with the following
    forum categories and forums:
        For Beginners
            -- Common Site Q&A

            -- Mac
            -- *nix
            -- Cross-Platform
            -- Tool Development

        You should create the following forums at minimum:
            Project Questions and Comments
            Archive of Posted Projects
            (restricted view) Projects Waiting
            (restricted view) Projects Available
            Team Talk
        The DP code depends on these forums to be present for automatically-generated
        threads when projects and teams are created. You will need the phpBB forum id
        numbers to put into the site-configuration for the DP code.

--- Install phpMyAdmin.
        While not required, it makes administering the database much easier.
        Follow the installation instructions included with phpMyAdmin.

--- Install jpgraph.
        The statistics code depends on jpgraph for graph generation.
        Follow the installation instructions included with jpgraph.
        The simplest place to install jpgraph is in your document root.
        You will need the location of the jpgraph installation to put into the
        site-configuration for the DP code.

--- Unpack the DP code.
        In your document root, unpack the DP code.
        This expands into a directory named 'c'.

--- Create other directories.

        /tmp/sp_check

        projects

        d
        d/stats
        d/stats/automodify_logs
        (You also need to put some stuff in d...)

        c/teams
        c/teams/icon
        c/teams/avatar

--- Configure the DP code (with site-specific settings).
        Make an editable copy of c/SETUP/configuration.sh,
        and put it outside your webserver's document hierarchy.
        (Or move out the whole SETUP directory, at the end of this step.)
        Modify your copy of configuration.sh as appropriate.
        (Any further help you need should be in the file itself rather than here.)
        Run c/SETUP/configure path-to-modified-configuration.sh path-to-code-dir
        The configure script will use your modified configuration.sh to update
        the DP code with your site-specific settings.

--- Create the tables of the DP database.
        cd c/SETUP
        php -f install_db.php
        Since you have already installed phpBB, you may get warnings/errors about
        duplicate tables.
        You will need to run some of upgrade scripts in the same way; cd to upgrade/06 and run:
        upgrade_news_table.php
        add_pg_books.php
	add_non_activated_users.php
        update_users.php
        create_quiz_passes_table.php
        create_current_tallies_table.php
        create_site_tally_goals_table.php
        create_past_tallies_table.php
        create_image_sources_table.php
        update_users_u_intlang.php
        create_uber_projects_table.php
        update_projects_table.php
        create_special_days_table.php
        create_page_events_table.php
        update_queue_defns.php
        (Maybe more?)

--- At this point, your DP site should be functional.
        Try visiting it via your browser.
        Register as a new user.
        Of course, there aren't any projects to proofread yet.

--- Define a site administrator.
        The code is based on users having particular roles. To manage these,
        a site administrator is needed. Assuming you are administering the
        site and have registered yourself as a new user, sign into mysql (or
        use the phpMyAdmin interface) to set sitemanager = "yes" for the
        username you registered as.

        From the mysql command line, this would be:

        mysql> UPDATE users SET sitemanager = "yes" WHERE username = "your_username";

--- Define project queues...

--- Install the modified dp.cron.
    The dp.cron contains entries for various processes necessary for site
    statistics and project archiving, as well as managing the project release
    queues, various user notifications, and the like.
    Check that the values inserted by the DP configuration script are correct,
    then install the crontab onto your system as an appropriate user.

--- Run stats/faq_data.php

# vim: ts=4 sw=4 expandtab ai
