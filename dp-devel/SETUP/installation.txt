Here's a first stab at installation instructions for the Distributed
Proofreaders website code. This assumes you're installing from scratch.
If you're upgrading from a previous version, things would be different ...

--- Install PHP (if it isn't already).
    
    
--- Install MySQL (if it isn't already).
    In the examples in this document, we will assume it's on "localhost",
    i.e. the same host on which you are running these commands, and the
    same host that runs the webserver.

--- Choose names for various MySQL items:
    --- the DP database (to house the DP data);
    --- the DP user (to handle all DP queries);
    --- the DP user's password.
    In the examples in this document, we will use
        dp_db
        dp_user
        dp_password
    for these three items. You may wish to choose names that are harder for
    others to guess (especially for the password!).

--- Set up MySQL to create the database and user:
    There are various ways to do each of these.
    We'll show how to do it using the mysql client.

    --- Connect to the MySQL server as the root user, or any sufficiently
        powerful user.
            mysql -h localhost -u root

    --- Create the database.
            CREATE DATABASE dp_db;
        If you have MySQL 4.1.1 or higher:
            CREATE DATABASE dp_db CHARACTER SET UTF8;

    --- Create the user.
        (See MySQL Manual 5.5.4 Adding New Users to MySQL.)
            GRANT ALL ON dp_db.* TO dp_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dp_password';
   
    --- Exit from the mysql client.
            quit

--- Unpack the DP code.
    ...

--- Configure the DP code (with site-specific settings).
    ...

--- Create the tables of the DP database.
        cd c/SETUP
        php -f install_db.php

--- At this point, your DP site should be functional.
    Try visiting it via your browser.
    Register as a new user.
    Of course, there aren't any projects to proof yet.
