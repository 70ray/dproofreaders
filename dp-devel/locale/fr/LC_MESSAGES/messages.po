"Distributed Proofreaders was founded in 2000 by Charles Franks to support "
"the digitization of Public Domain books. Originally conceived to assist <a "
"href='http://www.gutenberg.net' target='_new'>Project Gutenberg</a> (PG), "
"Distributed Proofreaders (DP) is now the main source of PG e-books. In 2002, "
"Distributed Proofreaders became an official Project Gutenberg site and as "
"such is supported by Project Gutenberg. If you have any questions or "
"comments regarding this site please e-mail: "

#: default.php:28
msgid ""
"This site provides a web-based method of easing the proofreading work "
"associated with the digitization of Public Domain books into Project "
"Gutenberg e-books. By breaking the work into individual pages many "
"proofreaders can be working on the same book at the same time. This "
"significantly speeds up the proofreading/e-book creation process."
msgstr ""

#: default.php:29
msgid ""
"When a proofer elects to proofread a page of a particular book, the text and "
"image file are displayed on a single web page. This allows the page text to "
"be easily reviewed and compared to the image file, thus assisting the "
"proofreading of the page text. The edited text is then submitted back to the "
"site via the same web page that it was edited on. A second proofreader is "
"then presented with the work of the first proofreader and the page image. "
"Once they have verified the work of the first proofreader and corrected any "
"additional errors the page text is again submitted back to the site."
msgstr ""

#: default.php:30
msgid ""
"Once all pages for a particular book have been processed, a post-processor "
"joins the pieces, properly formats them into a Project Gutenberg e-book and "
"submits it to the Project Gutenberg archive."

msgid ""
"The first step to take to help us out would be to register to be a new "
"proofreader.  You can do so by clicking <a href='accounts/addproofer."
"php'>here</a> or by clicking 'Register' at the top of the screen.  After you "
"register be sure to read over both the email you receive as well as FAQ "
"Central which provides helpful resources on how to proofread.  FAQ Central "
"can be reached <a href='{$code_url}/faq/faq_central.php'>here</a> or by "
"clicking 'Help' at the top of any screen.  After you have registered &amp; "
"read through some of the intro documents choose an interesting-looking book "
"from our Current Projects and try proofreading a page or two."
msgstr ""

#: default.php:35
msgid ""
"Remember that there is no commitment expected on this site. Proofread as "
"often or as seldom as you like, and as many or as few pages as you like.  We "
"encourage people to do 'a page a day', but it's entirely up to you! We hope "
"you will join us in our mission of 'preserving the literary history of the "
"world in a freely available form for everyone to use'."
