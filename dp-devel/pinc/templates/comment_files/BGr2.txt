<p><b><i>Thanks to all the new volunteers who have worked on this book.</i></b> Once all the MIA pages are rounded up and have been proofed, this book changes from a BEGINNERS ONLY project to a MENTORS project.</p>

<p><b>SECOND ROUND PROOFERS:</b> Please be aware that I promised our new volunteers that "experienced proofers will do a second round. They will send you some friendly suggestions if you are making any obvious beginner mistakes." <b>Please help by sending feedback and words of encouragement!</b></p>
