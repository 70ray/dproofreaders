<p><b><i>Thanks to all the new volunteers who have worked on this book.</i></b> Once all the MIA pages are rounded up and have been proofread, this book changes from a BEGINNERS ONLY project to a MENTORS project.</p>

<p><b>SECOND ROUND PROOFREADERS:</b> Please be aware that I promised our new volunteers that "experienced proofreaders will do a second round. They will send you some friendly suggestions if you are making any obvious beginner mistakes." <b>Please help by sending feedback and words of encouragement!</b></p> 

<p><b>NOTE:</b>You can find a list of which beginner has done which page, and  the number of pages proofread by each, at the <a href=http://www.pgdp.net/c/tools/proofers/for_mentors.php> For Mentors page</a>.</p>
