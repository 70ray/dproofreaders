 
The BAE projects have three special proofreading features (not all of them appearing in every project...):<br>


* Preserve the page numbers in index, tables of contents, etc (but not the number of the individual pages). Format index items in a special form<br>
* Use the (semi-standard) diacritic marks<br>
* you can use LaTeX-like markup for tables (optional, if you want to manually format the table it is always possible)<br>
<p>
They are discussed in <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=50987&start=2"> the Uber-Project thread</a>


<p>For the rest, refer to the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Proofreading Guidelines</a>.</p>
