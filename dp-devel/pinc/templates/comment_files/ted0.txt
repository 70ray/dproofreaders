<p>Please retain page references (like see page number x, or the page numbers
in the Table of Contents or Index), not actual page numbers at the top or
bottom of the page.
<p>Formatting is important; please format TOCs, lists of illustrations, etc.,
correctly.
<p>Please note any problems, observations, complains, request
for guidance etc., in that forum. There, we will reach
consensus and make a decision.
<p>Please EMAIL me with any problems (missing pages and the like) you may have. I
check my email several times per day and usually respond within 24 hours.
<p>I apologize in advance (mea culpa &lt;beats breast&gt;) for any missing pages or other difficulties.
If you encounter such, please post to the Missing Pages Wiki as well as making
a note in the appropriate forum and emailing me.
