<p>This is fairly straightforward. Follow the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Proofing Guidelines</a>, unless directed otherwise in the appropriate forum.
<p>Please note any problems, observations, etc, in that forum. There, we will reach consensus and make a decision. 
<p>I especially want to know if you think this work is not EASY, or AVERAGE, or whatever. I don't always know what makes something easy, as I consider transcribing Greek fun or proofing Latin. Sidenotes don't bother me at all. Footnotes? Make 'em long! So you can see that I might not know what is EASY.
<p>You can also reach me in Jabber (I hang out there quite a bit). Failing that, PM me and I will try to respond within the day. (The response may not make sense... :) )
