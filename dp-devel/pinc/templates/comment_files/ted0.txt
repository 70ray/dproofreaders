<p>This is fairly straightforward. Follow the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Proofing Guidelines</a>, unless directed otherwise in the appropriate forum.
<p>Please note any problems, observations, etc, in that forum. There, we will reach consensus and make a decision. 
<p>You can also reach me in Jabber (I hang out there quite a bit). Failing that, PM me and I will try to respond within the day. (The response may not make sense... :) )
