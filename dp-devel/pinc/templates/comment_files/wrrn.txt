<h3>Keep Text as Close to Original as Possible!</h3>

<p>We've had some mention of people changing things like "* * *" to "..." &ndash; <strong>Please do not make such substitutions!</strong>  Please keep all text as close to the original as possible.

<h3>Copyrighted Materials</h3>

<p>Some of the content in the Warren Report and its supporting evidentiary and testimonial volumes is still under copyright. As a result, we are not allowed to include this copyrighted material in Project Gutenberg. Most (if not all) of this material has been identified, and place-holders have been included in the page images to indicate where these copyrighted materials occur.</p>

<p>If you come across any materials (e.g., photographs, movie stills, etc.) that you think may need to be removed, please post a comment in the project thread.</p>

<h3>Crossed-Out Words</h3>

<p>In some places, words have been crossed out, removed, or redacted in some other way.  Please mark these in one of the following two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the word is readable, please print the word and put a note after it like, [**word crossed out]</li>
  <li>If it is not readable, please just put a [**note] where it occurs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Underlined Text</h3>

<p>Some of the Commission Exhibits contain documents that have underlined text.  The Proofing Guidelines say to mark underlined text similarly to italicized text; <strong>however,</strong> we would like for this project to have underlined text marked with &lt;u&lt; and &lt;/u&lt; tags.  For example:

<pre>  Here is some <u>underlined</u> text.</pre>

<p>Should be marked as:</p>

<pre>  Here is some &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; text.</pre>

<h3>Dialogue</h3>

<p>The testimonial volumes are primarily dialogue. Please mark the speaker's names as bold (i.e., with &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; tags), like so:</p>

<pre>&lt;b&gt;Mr. RANKIN.&lt;/b&gt; Mrs. Oswald, did you write in Russian a story of your experiences in the United States?

&lt;b&gt;Mrs. OSWALD.&lt;/b&gt; Yes, I have. I think that you are familiar with it.</pre>

<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> Please include the period inside the bold tags.)</p>

<h3>Image Captions</h3>

<p>Please put the image caption at the front of the illustration tag, even if the caption itself is below the image's text.  For example:</p>

<pre>     [Illustration: COMMISSION EXHIBIT NO. 350

     Windshield of Presidential limousine.]</pre>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p>All of the footnotes are kept in a single volume.  Please mark the place where footnotes are referenced using standard out-of-line footnote markers. For example:</p>

<pre>     Some note[3].</pre>

<p>The footnote itself should remain at the bottom of the page, like so:</p>

<pre>     [Footnote 3: Text of some note.]</pre>

<h3>Superscripts</h3>

<p>In some places, there are superscripted letters that don't refer to footnotes. (This may be in the Report only, but we're not entirely sure.)  Please mark these using TeX-style markup, e.g., ^{A}</p>

<p>Multiple superscripts may be combined into one: ^{A B}</p>

<h3>Dashes</h3>

<p>Recently the Proofing Guidelines changed so that all dashes are now represented by two hyphens (--).  <b>However,</b> in the testimony, it is very clear that some dashes are longer than others.  For longer dashes, please use four hyphens (----).</p>

<p>Note that hyphens should still have only one hyphen (-).</p>

<h3>Grayscale Images</h3>

<p>Each text file in the Evidence volumes (XVI-XXVI) has a URL a grayscale image for that page.  These URLs are there for your reference, to help you identify portions that may not be clear in the black &amp; white version of the page.</p>

<p>The grayscale images are hosted by <a href="http://www.pluckerbooks.com/">Pluckerbooks.com</a>.  Pluckerbooks runs off d.maddock1's cablemodem connection, so please be nice.  Also, because d.maddock1's ISP blocks port 80 (the standard HTTP port), the site runs off port 81, which means you may have trouble accessing the images from behind a firewall and/or proxy.</p>

<h3>Non-Standard Formatting</h3>

<p>Many of the exhibits (which are given in the later volumes) are things like forms and charts which will be very hard to format using only ASCII text.  We just ask that you do your best.  Don't worry about trying to make sure all the lines are exact &ndash; it's the text and meaning of the documents that are important.</p>

<h3>Anything Else</h3>

<p>Please jump over to the forums if you have any questions about anything else.</p>
