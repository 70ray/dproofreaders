<p>BASIC INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p><b>Here are a few basic instructions.</b> Please print and refer to the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/summary.pdf">Handy Proofing Guide</a>, and consult the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Proofing 
Guidelines</a> to go beyond these basics. </p>

<p><b>Make the text look like the page image except as per below! That means leaving in the breaks at the ends of the lines, leaving spelling "mistakes", etc. Mostly your job is to fix OCR mistakes. </b></p>

<p>---1. If a line ends in a hyphenated word, move the first part of the following line up to rejoin the word, then insert a line break at the end of the rejoined word. Remove the hyphen unless it is a compound word normally hyphenated.</p>

<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>"I say, Graham, do you know what's hap-</br>
pened? There'll be an awful row about it."</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>"I say, Graham, do you know what's happened?</br>
There'll be an awful row about it."</p>

<p>---2. Leave in (or add) the blank line between paragraphs and remove the indent at the beginning of a paragraph, if any. Change the first word of the chapter to normal capitalization if it is in all caps.</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>THE ship moved slowly out of the harbour as Tom Woodward slumped
<br>in his seat and breathed a sigh of relief.
<br>__He turned to the package he had dropped next to him on the deck
<br>and examined its label.</p>
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>The ship moved slowly out of the harbour as Tom Woodward slumped
<br>in his seat and breathed a sigh of relief. </p>
<p>He turned to the package he had dropped next to him on the deck
<br>and examined its label.</p>

<p>---3. Remove extra space around punctuation. Make it look like common usage today.</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>The girl looked at him with tears in her eyes ; she began to cry.
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>The girl looked at him with tears in her eyes; she began to cry.</p>

<p><p>---4. Remove spaces in words with contractions like "don't" and "isn't"</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
"Do n't!" he cried. "You 'll ruin the whole thing!"
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
"Don't!" he cried. "You'll ruin the whole thing!"</p>

<p>---5. Fix long dashes (em-dashes) by inserting an additional hyphen character if needed; represent long dashes with two hyphens.</p>
<p><i>Scan Example:</i>
<br>He walked over to the window-a strange look on his face-and
<br>tapped on the glass. "Susan!---- Over here!"
<p><i>Corrected Example:</i>
<br>He walked over to the window--a strange look on his face--and
<br>tapped on the glass. "Susan!--Over here!"</p>

<p>---6. If you have a page with a poem on it, READ THE <a 
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php#poetry">PROOFING 
GUIDELINES</a>, to see how to handle it.</p>

<p>---7. <i>Italics?</i> READ THE <a 
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php#italics">PROOFING 
GUIDELINES</a>! Insert <tt>&lt;i&gt;</tt> at the start and 
<tt>&lt;/i&gt;</tt> at the end.</p>

<p>---8. <b>Bold?</b> READ THE <a 
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php#bold">PROOFING 
GUIDELINES</a>! Insert <tt>&lt;b&gt;</tt> before the bold text 
and <tt>&lt;/b&gt;</tt>after it.

<p>---9. Illustrations? READ THE <a 
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php#illust">PROOFING 
GUIDELINES</a>! Use the tags.

<p>--10. Footnotes? READ THE <a 
href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php#footnotes">PROOFING 
GUIDELINES</a>! Use the tags. 

<p>--<b>Most of all--Have fun!</b></p>

<p>SHARING INFORMATION, ASKING QUESTIONS, REPORTING PROBLEMS:</p>
<p>This site has an internal message system. Your personal page shows how many private messages are waiting in your inbox (in the dark green navbar). Please go to the forums and login to read messages from round 2 proofers. If you have questions that need a more immediate answer, please click on the "discuss this project" link above. That will take you to a forum thread that is specific to this project where you can see what other new people have asked and can get reasonably quick responses from experienced proofers. There are also several other forums that you may use to ask questions or make comments that are not project-specific.</p>

<p>This scanned and OCR'd pretty cleanly, but if you notice <b>recurring</b> OCR errors, please post a message in the discussion forum (as described above). That way, we will be alert for them in post-processing.</p>
