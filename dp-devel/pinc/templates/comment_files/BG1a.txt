<p><b><i>Welcome New Volunteers!!</i></b></p>
<p><b>This is a BEGINNERS ONLY/FEEDBACK project. We have set this book aside for our newest proofreaders.</b> You are doing the first of two proofing passes over these pages. When the book has completed the first round of proofing, more experienced proofers will do a second round. They will send you some friendly suggestions if you are making any obvious beginner mistakes. Please only do a few pages (5-15) of this book, then move on to something else. <b><i>It may be 3 or 4 days before feedback is sent to your DP inbox; so do tackle another project that interests you while you're waiting!</i></b></p>

<p>Please note that the proofers who review your work only see one page at a time; they do not have an overview of all the pages you proof in this book. <b><i>You might get similar comments from several proofers. Please excuse any repetition!</i></b></p>
