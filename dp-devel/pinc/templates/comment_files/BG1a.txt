<p><b><i>Welcome New Volunteers!!</i></b></p>
<p><b>This is a BEGINNERS ONLY/FEEDBACK project. We have set this book aside for our newest proofreaders.</b> You are doing the first of three proofing passes over these pages, making sure the words and punctuation in the text box match those in the scanned picture (or image) of the printed page. When the book has completed the first round of proofing, more experienced proofers will do a second round. They will send you some friendly suggestions if you are making any obvious beginner mistakes. Please only do a few pages (5 or so) of this book, then move on to something else. It may be a week before feedback is sent to your DP inbox; so do work on another project that interests you while you're waiting!</p>

<p>Please note that the proofers who review your work see one page at a time; they may not have an overview of all the pages you proof in this book. You might get similar comments from several proofers.</p>

<p>Following three proofing rounds, these pages will move on to two rounds of Formatting, where other volunteers will fine-tune the look of the page. They will insert mark-up to represent font variations (such as italics, bold, and small caps), spacing, indentation, footnotes, and the like. In the final stages, a post-processor will transform the proofed and formatted text into a readable e-book. If you wish to be notified when this text is posted to PG, put a check in the "event subscription" box labeled "Project posted to Project Gutenberg." Event subscriptions are located below the project comments.</p>
