<h2><a name="introduction">Welcome to DP!</a></h2>
<br>
We really appreciate you dropping by to help out. 
Every page helps a lot, so please don't feel that your effort doesn't make a difference: it certainly does! Come right in!
<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br>

<h2><a name="section1">The View</a></h2>
<br>

There's a lot to look at, isn't there? Can be confusing at first. 
Take a seat, take your time, let's have a look around.
<br>
<br>
First up, let's look at the top of the page, where people tend to put things they think are important.
<br>
<br>
It says, "Project Gutenberg's Distributed Proofreaders" 
(you'll see this logo on all our pages, and clicking on it will always bring you back to our front page), 
then underneath that in sneaky small print: "Preserving History One Page at a Time". 
What is this: are we preserving history in small print? A bit quiet about it, anyway. 
If you're looking at that, we're starting in the same place. Good start. (puts on her glasses) 
Oh, not so small print. Much better! Now I can see what's in that line underneath, aha, it's a 
<br>
<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>
<h2><a name="section2">Menu Bar</a></h2>
<br>
Yep, this is the main menu of <b>your</b> Personal Page. The whole thing about this page is that it is <b>your</b> page. 
The things on this menu-bar are <b>your</b> things. They are different from everybody else's, and they are private. 
Whenever you drop in to see us and help us out, you see <b>your</b> page, this page. 
Nobody else sees your page. (Shall I repeat all that again? Nope? Got it? OK.)
<br>
<br>

Starting on the left of the dark-green menu-bar (my favourite colour, as it happens), it now says <br>
<br>
"DP &rarr; Personal Page for (your username)" .<br>
<br>

This is a handy reminder of where you are, one step from the front (home) page of DP. 
Wherever you go on our DP site, this "crumb trail" will show you where you are.
<br>

<br>

Going across to the right, we see:
<br><br>

<ul>

<li><b>Help</b></li>

<li><b>Forums</b></li>

<li><b>Inbox</b></li>

<li><b>Preferences</b></li>

<li><b>Statistics</b></li>

<li><b>Log Out</b></li>

</ul>

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>

<h3><a name="section3">Help</a></h3>

<br>

When you click on "Help", you get a screen full of DP FAQs (lists of Frequently-Asked Questions) and useful information. 
This is bound to come in handy, but mightn't be what you're looking for at the time, 
especially if you're up to <i>here</i> with information already and just want some direct contact. 
Do not despair, we'll go into that in a minute. 
Think of the Help link more as a bookshelf of useful stuff. 
It's all good, and will answer many of your questions, so dig in when you have time.

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h3><a name="section4">Forums</a></h3>

<br>

This is your personal link into the <b>Forums</b>. When you click on this, you enter the Forums <i>as you</i>. 
Any posts or replies that you make will come from your username.  
When you log into DP, you are also logged into the Forums.<br>



<br>

The Forums are where people ask questions (aha!), have discussions and generally share ideas. 
Clicking on this link will take you to the <b>Forum Index</b>. 
This has grown quite a bit, but by scrolling down you can see that we try to cover everything people might want to discuss. 
You're welcome to enter any forum, but you may find the <b>Beginners' Forums</b> at the top, most useful to begin with. 
Check there first to find if your question has been asked and answered already; 
if not, post it and you'll hear back rsn (real soon now :) ).<br>

<br>

If you've ever used a Forum or Bulletin Board System (BBS) before, you know how if works, but in any case, it's not complicated. 
Someone has an idea, e.g. I might think that the whole Personal Page should be dark green. 
I hit <b>"new post"</b> to open a new topic (idea).  
Just like when writing an email, I fill in the <b>subject</b>: "How about a dark green Personal Page?" 
and then write what I want to say in the <b>body</b> of the post. 
I can click on <b>smilies</b> to illustrate my feelings about what I write. 
I can <b>preview</b> my post, and check that it looks OK, and then <b>submit</b> the post, 
or I can just <b>submit</b> it straight away. 
In any case, I can always <b>edit</b> my post afterwards if I want.<br>

<br>

[Please note that in some of the forums (e.g. the Project forum created for each book proofed) you can't create a New Topic, only Reply. 
This helps keep things on track.]<br>

<br>

Other people read my post, and I get replies, 
saying "You goof, if the whole page were dark green, we wouldn't be able to see the menu-bar" and other constructive things. 
I can write back, saying "So change the colour of the menu-bar," and as you can see, 
a discussion has been started which anybody on DP can join in. 
Each topic grows as people <b>reply</b> to it, and forums grow and change as people add new topics. 
It's a lot of fun, very useful and informative, and it's an important part of DP.<br>

<br>

We'll talk more about forums in a later page, but those are the basics, and you're very welcome to contribute! 
More also about the <b>Teams</b> forums in particular, later in <i>this</i> page.<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h3><a name="section5">Inbox</a></h3>

<br> 

Now <b>this is personal</b>. This is your own, private Inbox on DP. 
It's not for email, it's for <b>Private Messages</b> (PMs) between you and other DP-ers. Nobody else reads your mail. 
If you have new messages waiting, next to the <b>Inbox</b> link you will see <b>(2 unread)</b> or however many it is.<br>

<br>

When you click on that link, and go to your Inbox, you see any messages waiting. 
As with email, you can <b>read</b>, <b>reply</b> (<b>quoting</b> or not), <b>save</b> or <b>delete</b> messages. <br>

<br>

If you know someone's DP username, you can type that into the <b>To:</b> field. 
If you aren't sure about the username, you can click on the <b>new post</b> link next to the 
<b>Distributed Proofreaders Forum Index</b> and then you can <b>search</b> for the username. <br>

<br>

For example, you might remember that someone called themselves Froggy something, but you're not sure. 
Putting "frog*" into the search may turn up Frogfish, Bigfrog and Froggy2. 
If the last one is the one you remember, you pick that. Handy, really. 
The * is a wildcard, and matches any string of letters.<br>

<br>

Helpful people at DP will send you feedback about your proofreading, to help you settle in, 
and those early messages will come to your <b>Inbox</b>. 

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h3><a name="section6">Preferences</a></h3>

<br>

Are you comfortable? Seat too high or too low? You can choose what suits you best. 
When you click on the Preferences link, you get a whole stack of choices that can be a bit overwhelming, 
so I'll sort them out a bit here.<br>

<br>

This is <b>your</b> preferences pane (window). You can change it anytime.<br>

<br>

Don't miss the question marks next to each choice. They explain things to you, so I won't go into detail here.<br>

<br>

The <i>top</i> half of the window is <i>general</i> preferences. 
The <i>bottom</i> half is about the <i>proofreading interface,</i> where you actually do your proofreading.<br>

<br>

In the <i>top</i> half:<br><br>


<ul>

<li>you can change <b>profiles</b> (for example, you might want one for work and one for home)</li>

<li>you can change your DP <b>real name</b></li>

<li>you can change your<b> email address</b></li>

<li>you can choose to receive<b> email updates</b> from DP or not</li>

<li>you can choose to see the list of texts available for proofreading, from the first or second <b>round</b> 
(process of proofreading), or from both.</li>

<li>you can choose from several <b>languages</b> used in the DP site</li>

<li>you can reset your <b>password</b></li>

<li>you can choose from several different <b>themes</b> (the way DP looks to you)</li>

<li>you can choose from several <b>languages</b> used in the proofreading <b>interface</b></li>

<li>you can choose if your <b>statistics</b> (how many pages you proof etc.) are seen by other DPers or not</li>

</ul><br>

Over to the right-hand side of the <i>top</i> half, now:<br><br>

<ul>

<li>here you can save different <b>profiles</b>, then choose them from that <b>menu</b></li>

<li>what <b>screen resolution</b> works best for your monitor and browser?</li>

<li>do you want the <b>proofreading interface</b> to be standard or enhanced?</li>

</ul> <blockquote>You can try both out. 
The enhanced interface doesn't work with some  browsers, I think it was written for Internet Explorer, 
but the standard one works with most. 
You will want to experiment with interface and browser until you find what works best for you.</blockquote>

<ul>

<li>Do you want the original scan on the <b>left</b>, and the output text on the <b>right</b>? 
This is the <b>vertical</b> layout, as the line separating text and image runs vertically. 
You can also choose to have the original scan <b>above</b> and the output text <b>below</b>: 
this is the horizontal layout, as the line separating text and image runs horizontally. 
Again, you want to experiment and suit yourself.</li>

<li>Do you want the proofreading interface to pop up in a <b>new window</b>, or not?</li>

<li>Do you want to be able to see the <b>toolbar</b> from your browser, above the interface?</li>

<li>Do you want to be able to see the <b>statusbar</b> from your browser, below the interface?</li>

<li>Do you want the <b>top ten</b> proofers listed on your Personal Page?</li>

<li>Do you want the <b>status bar</b> on your Personal Page, to run down the <b>left</b> or <b>right</b> side?</li>

</ul><br>


You can come here and change any of these things at any time.<br>

<br>

Now, for the <i>proofreading interface</i> choice, in the <i>bottom</i> half of the window. (takes a deep breath)<br><br>



Depending on what <i>layout</i> you have chosen, <i>side-by-side</i> (vertical) or <i>up-and-down</i> (horizontal), 
you make choices in that section. 
To start with, you might like to leave them as they are suggested ("the default values", which work for most people), 
and see how you go. 
The choices are the same for each layout:<br>

<br>

<ul>

<li>What <b>font</b> do you want to use?</li>

</ul> <blockquote>DPCustomMono has been carefully crafted to help with proofreading: 
although that makes it a <i>really ugly</i> font, it shows up errors much more clearly. 
See <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=31521#31521">this post</a> for info about our special font 
(which you need to download and install, nothing too complex, and it does help).<br><br>

Again, you will want to experiment. Your browser may fuss about font choices. Browsers vary in this.</blockquote>

<ul>

<li>how much bigger or smaller that the original book size do you want the <b>image</b> (the scanned picture of the page) to be?</li>

</ul> <blockquote>You can enlarge the scan from the proofreading interface, too. See how you go.</blockquote>


<ul>

<li>how big do you want the <b>text page</b>, output by the scanner, to be?</li>

<li>do you want to be able to <b>scroll</b> that page?</li>

<li>how many <b>lines</b> to the page?</li>

<li>how <b>long</b> do you want the lines to be?</li>

<li>do you want the text to <b>wrap</b>, go to the next line when it gets too long?</li>

</ul><br>



Now you can <b>save your preferences</b>, the choices you have just made, <b>save a new profile</b> if you have made one, 
or <b>quit</b>.<br>

<br>

The Preferences page is very useful to fine-tune your proofreading screen, or if things are not working for some reason. 
Preferences are <b>your choices</b>. You can fiddle with them so things work right for you.<br>

<br>

In the Forums, there is another Preferences page, called (just for variety) your <b>Profile</b> 
(link at the top of any <b>Forum</b> page). 
You will find it useful and fun to experiment with this one, too, as it lets you choose how the forums work for you, 
and (for example) how to have avatars (icons or small pictures) next to your name and details. 
It all helps to make things more personal for you and me, here on DP.<br>

<br>

Meanwhile, back at the Personal Page, on that menu-bar, next we see

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h3><a name="section7">Statistics</a></h3>

<br>

These are <b>your personal statistics</b>, just as this is <b>your menu-bar</b>. 
By clicking on this, you can luxuriate in all sorts of data about yourself and what you are doing on the DP site. 
People have lots of fun competing, and it's very interesting to see your history after a while. 
A bit like looking in the mirror, but you don't have to worry about your weight or acne. Check it out!

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>

<h3><a name="section8">Log Out</a></h3>

<br>

which is, uh, where you log out. You. Nobody else. <b>Log out here.</b>

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h2><a name="section9">What's Happening Now? (News Update etc.)</a></h2>

<br>

The main part of your Personal Page is changing all the time. 
Every time you log on, there will be news, helpful info, and new things to proof! Let's start at the top:

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>


<h3><a name="section10">Personal Message and Update</a></h3>

<br>

We're talking to <b>you</b>! Here is our personal welcome, our news for the day, how things are going at DP: get it here, get it hot!<br>

<br>

This part changes a lot, and keeps you up to date with DP, especially with our daily efforts, our themes, 
and occasional miseries (such as our upstream-provider going down and us being off the air for several hours, grrrr). 
Keep an eye on this!<br>



<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br>



<h3><a name="section11">For Brand-New Proofers</a></h3>

<br>

Next, a welcome and reminder for new people. 
We treasure each and every proofer we have, and we want you to enjoy being part of DP. <br>

<br>

People are continually growing and changing with DP, so we need them to move on to new challenges, 
allowing the newest people to have a bite of what we have prepared for them. 
Everybody finds their own comfort level here, but we all start at the beginning!

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>


<h3><a name="section12">Providing Content</a></h3>

<br>

Can you see this on your page? If not, we will put it in a bit later on, after you've proofed some more pages, 
for example, so as not to confuse you with too much stuff on the page, at once. 
If you wish to skip these upcoming details now, please go to <a href="#section15">the Book List.</a><br>

<br>

Content providers are our chefs! They cook up tasty texts for us to proof. 
They work particularly hard to make sure we have an interesting range of different types of books, 
with something, we hope, for everyone.<br>

<br>

If you want to see a specific book here (perhaps one you like, one you are interested in), 
you are welcome to post about it in the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=9">Providing Content Forum</a>.<br>

<br>

You may choose to be a Content Provider when you have settled in here. 
We all grow and change, and choose what suits us best.

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h3><a name="section13">Post-Processing</a></h3>

<br>

Again, if you can't see this, it will show up after 400 pages proofed.<br>

<br>

Post-Processors are our wrapping artists. 
They put the whole e-book together when we have finished proofreading it (twice, two rounds of checking), 
and they make it all into the most attractive and most easily-read package, for serving from Project Gutenberg.<br>

<br>

You may become particularly interested in a text, and wish to post-process it. 
You can post about this in the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewforum.php?f=3">Post-Processing Forum</a>.<br>

<br>

We value any and all effort you feel able to give, and post-processing is another of the choices <i>we</i> give <i>you</i>.

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>


<h3><a name="section14">The Random Rule</a></h3>

<br>

This, too, will pop up as a development of your Personal Page after you have proofed a few pages.<br>

<br>

What is the Random Rule? A devious concept, that's what it  is ... 
you may think that you can't remember all the Proofreading Guidelines, but, day by day 
(or each time you refresh your Personal Page), we remind you of one at a time, and they stick in your mind!<br>

<br>

You may this very useful. 
You will have the printed <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/summary.pdf">Handy Guide</a>, 
which summarizes the Guidelines (keep that beside you as you proof!), 
and also the whole <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/c/faq/document.php">Guidelines</a> saved (somewhere), 
but this little Random Rule may help you remember things much better.<br>

<br>

Each time, one proofreading rule is explained, and it really does help you to remember.<br>

<br>

A couple of seconds spent reading this Random Rule will save you confusion later on.<br>

<br>

Now, finally, as we move down your Personal Page, we find what DP is all about:

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h2><a name="section15">Books for Everyone</a></h2>

<br>

Here is (we hope) a long and interesting list of books. 
They are coloured according to themes (could be your favourite!).<br><br>

They are listed in the order they came into this queue, except for <b>Beginners'</b> books, which are listed first.<br>



<br>

The top list of books is those which have come straight from the Content Providers' steaming scanners:<b> Round One.</b> 
They may be full of errors, or they may not, according to the <i>scanner</i> (expensive? good software?), 
the state of the <i>original</i> book (faded? damaged?) and the <i>complexity</i> of the text 
(strange print? lots of footnotes? multiple columns?).


They are rated from <b>Beginners Only</b> (for very new proofers only) through <b>Easy</b> to <b>Hard</b> 
with helpful comments. 
<b>Easy</b> books are usually straight text, novels or non-fiction, very few or no footnotes, no hassles.
If a book doesn't show a difficulty, it's "average".<br>

<br>

It's up to you where you feel comfortable proofreading. 
Some people stay in one level or type of text, others dart around like dragonflies, flitting and sipping, 
some suffer from acute masochism and specialize in heavy footnoting or strange markup. 
Once you've settled in and done some Beginners' and Easy texts, you can take your pick.<br>

<br>

You can see the books' <b>title</b>, the <b>author</b>, the <b>language</b> the book is written in 
(and we try to have as great a variety as possible: 
please note your language skills in <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=2384">this post</a> in the Forums), 
the <b>genre</b> (novel? history? great dog story?), 
the <b>project manager</b> (who is looking after this book: good person to ask questions about it), 
how many <b>pages available</b> for proofreading right now (or as close to right now as the database gets) 
and the <b>total pages</b> in that book.<br>

<br>

When you click on the <b>title</b> of a book, the <b>proofreading interface</b> pops up in front of you 
like something out of a trap-door (but friendly!). 
You can stop change your mind and <b>stop proofreading</b>, 
<b>save</b> proofed pages and <b>go on</b> proofreading, start and stop whenever suits you. 
This is <i>your DP.</i><br>

<br>

Can you see a second list of books (<b>Second Round</b>)? 
Again, we're trying not to overload you with detail, and will introduce this list a bit later on, after 50 pages proofed. 
The second list of books is those which have already been through Round One. 
But they should be perfect now? I hear you protest. Um, yeah. 
That would be nice, but the <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1563">scannos</a> 
(sneaky things the scanner does, e. g. l for 1 and 0 for O) do tend to slip past us. 
We've found by experience that what one person misses 
(and the better the reader you are, the more likely your eye is to correct as it reads, and thus miss the errors!), 
another will often find. 
Thus, we have two goes at each book. 
<b>Round Two</b> books are listed in alphabetical order, making it just a little easier for you to find a favourite book, 
or one that's recommended to you, later on.

<br>

<p align="right"><a href="#toc">Contents</a></p><hr width="50%" align="right"><br><br>



<h2><a name="section16">How Are We Going?</a></h2>

<br>

You tell me. Have you got a headache yet? No? (we ask hopefully)<br>

<br>

Another way to find out how we're going (stop clutching your head, it isn't that bad!) 
is with the help of your Personal Page's <b>Status Bar</b>.<br>

<br>

On the left (or the right) of the page, according to the choice you make in your Preferences, this bar runs down the page. 
It's always there, and it keeps some useful info. in front of you.<br>

<br>

Starting at the top, there are shortcut links to start <b>proofreading projects</b> 
(this takes you from the front page of DP to the page with the lists of books), 
and to <b>post-processing</b> (a whole different page for those people),<br>

<br>

Going down...<br>

<br>

<b>Site Statistics</b> tell us how we're going today and this month (all our personal stats. added together!). 
We set ourselves daily and monthly goals, and it's a lot of fun trying to meet them. 
We achieve a lot, and we're proud of it. 
These numbers are updated every 20-60 minutes, depending on how many other jobs the server has at the time. 
It can get pretty exciting when we're hanging on the counter at DP midnight to see the daily total, 
propping our eyelids open with toothpicks(ouch! sharp!).<br>

<br>

Next floor... your <b>Personal Statistics!</b>.<br>

<br>

Where <b>you're</b> up to! 
It's fun making your personal goals, as well, and this tells you your total, your rank out of everybody at DP, 
and what sort of proofer you are! 
(Psst! Please keep your magic rank-name secret, so everybody gets happy surprises when they pass another level. 
If you tell, you may find yourself promoted to <i>Dungeon-Sweeper</i>...).<br>

<br>

Remember, this is a only a few of your stats: lots more on your own Statistics Page 
(click on your <b>Statistics</b> link in your <b>Menu-bar</b>).<br>

<br>

Next!<br>

<br>

<b>Your Teams</b>. What Teams? We hear you ask. Fair question. 
Everybody is a member of the overall DP Team, but we've found it's also fun to optionally join different Teams. 
So, you can join up to three other teams, and enjoy the competition. 
You also get to enjoy the camaraderie, the mutual support, the chat and the shared interests. 
See <a href="http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=5339">this post</a> in the Beginners' Q & A Forum.<br>

<br>

You can <b>View All Teams</b>, scrolling through the Teams list to choose one, or more, you like. 
You can even create new teams! 
(You might want to check that someone hasn't already created the team you're thinking of, before you do, though.)<br>

<br>

You may remember seeing the <b>Team Talk</b> forum when you were scrolling through the <b>Forum Index</b> earlier on. 
This is where Team-members chat and share. 
Your Team will be listed there, and you are welcome to read different Team threads, 
even chat and post in them, to see what they are like.<br>

<br>

Down, down....<br>

<br>

You can choose to have the <b>Top Ten Proofers</b> listed here, if you like. 
Some of those guys are <i>hot!</i> (Could be you, one day...)<br>

<br>

You can choose to have the people over and under you in the proofreading stats, shown here. 
This is your <b>proofreading neighbourhood</b>, and it's fun to watch it change. 
Will you pass treefrog today? Will canetoad pass you? (Hope not!)<br>

<br>

The link to <b>see more statistics here</b> is full of stats! How have we been going recently? 
How about the last month? Since starting DP? Compare this, that and the other. Lots of graphs.<br>

<br>

Under that ...<b>Key Help Documents</b>.<br>

<br>

Here are some helpful links. Look here first! 
You'll probably want to download these and keep them on your computer. Really useful reading.<br>

<br>


<b>Support Requests</b> is a new development (thankyou programmers!), 
a page where you can report bugs or problems and ask for changes. You get a quick and helpful response. 
Don't ever think the DP programmers aren't busy! 
They have a big list of projects, and are working on changes all the time. In between cuppas, of course.<br>

<br>

Last of all...



Project Gutenberg, and DP, are non-profit organizations. All right, we're <b>poor</b>, OK? 
Desperately, grovellingly <b>poor</b>. Everything we have is donated, time, books, equipment, software. 
If you can spare a dime... well, more would be nice... and it might be tax-deductible in your country... 
look, we just need the money. Please. Every little bit helps, just as every single page helps.
