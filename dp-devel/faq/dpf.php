<h1>The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation</h1>

<p>
This document provides some basic facts about the Distributed
Proofreaders Foundation (DPF). DPF is the not-for-profit corporation
that receives and processes donations to Distributed Proofeaders, and
seeks fundraising opportunities.
</p>

<h2>Mission:</h2>

<p>
The Distributed Proofreaders Foundation has been formed to support the
Distributed Proofreaders (DP) website (www.pgdp.net) which has existed,
in one form or another, since about October, 2000. DP volunteers
transcribe books and periodicals that are in the public domain into
electronic texts using software that has been developed by DP
volunteers. These electronic texts are freely distributed for the
benefit of anyone who can use them. 
</p>
<p>
While currently DP only transcribes text into ebooks, related activities
that might be included on the existing website in the future, or
supported by DPF in some fashion, include transcription of musical
notation, cooperative translation, and public access to the scanned
material produced by DP volunteers. In this sense, DPF's mission goes
beyond simple support of the DP website to the wider goal of
transcribing, into digital form, freely distributable material that is
currently only available on paper.
</p>

<h2>Organization:</h2>

<p>
DPF is a not-for-profit corporation registered in the state of
New Jersey. The registered office address of the corporation is:
</p>
<p style="margin: 0em 0em 0em 3em;">
Distributed Proofreaders Foundation<br>
319 Park St<br>
Montclair, NJ 07043<br>
USA
</p>

<h2>Tax Status:</h2>
<p>
DPF applied for tax exempt status by the IRS under section
501(c)(3) of the US Internal Revenue Code on July 31, 2006. 
</p>

<h2>Donations:</h2>

<p>
Our understanding is that now that DPF has made the application for
501(c)(3) status, donations are tax-deductible, with that status being
removed retroactively if the application is turned down. We believe that
DPF should have no trouble qualifying. All of this only matters to
donors who file US tax returns.
</p>
<p>
The PayPal donation button on the PGDP website directs donations to DPF.
Donations made by check should be made payable to "Distributed
Proofreaders Foundation" and mailed to the above address. DPF also
gladly accepts donations of stock.

</p>
<p>
DPF will report on its finances regularly (at least yearly, more often
if it seems appropriate) to the volunteers. 
</p>

<h2>Use of Donations:</h2>

<p>
Money donated to DPF will be used to support this website, and
possibly other DPs, as determined by the Board.
</p>
<p>
In the past, expenses which PGLAF incurred on behalf of DP have included
registration of domain names, buying high-speed scanner set-ups, buying
our server, and paying for the hosting of our server. Hosting costs have
been paid by PGLAF for this year (through Feb, 2007 I believe). DPF
will, of course, be assuming responsibility for our future expenses. DPF
has requested that PGLAF transfer ownership of the DP domain names to DPF.
</p>
<p>
It is unlikely that DP will have any paid staff in the foreseeable
future. Some software development may be contracted out, as necessary.
Funds raised by DPF will be used to support the website, recruit new
volunteers, improve the custom software, buy additional hardware as
needed, and for such other items as the Board determines are
appropriate.
</p>

<h2>Board Members:</h2>

<p>
There are currently three board members:
</p>

<ul>
<li>  Charles Franks</li>
<li>  Juliet Sutherland</li>
<li>  Greg Newby</li>

available electronically as soon as possible.
</p>

<h2>History:</h2>

<p>
When Distributed Proofreaders (DP) was founded by Charles Franks in 2000
it was just a website hosted on his home computer. He accepted
contributions towards the operating costs of the site, but they were not
tax-deductible. Sometime around July 2002, he decided to officially
associate the website with Project Gutenberg, so that PGLAF (Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation), which already existed as a
non-profit, tax-deductible donation-accepting organization, could deal
with the financial matters. Charles turned over the money that had been
donated to DP to PGLAF and from that time, PGDP operated under the
financial umbrella and corporate protection of PGLAF. 
</p>
<p>
Since then, DP has grown enough that it makes sense for us to become our
own legal identity and have financial independence. The
incorporation documents and by-laws have been written to be as generic
as possible, allowing great flexibility on the part of the Board. This
will allow the Foundation the maximum opportunity to grow and change as
time and circumstances dictate. 
</p>
<p>
As indicated by the presence of Greg Newby (CEO of PGLAF) as a Trustee, the
establishment of DPF does not imply any change in DP's support of, or
alignment with, PG's mission. DPF simply formalizes what has been true
all along, that DP is a separate organization from PG.
