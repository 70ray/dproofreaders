Check for poetry or other indented material. Mark the end of each line with **.
</p>
<p>
Exit Word, saving the file under a new name (so that the original remains in case you really mess things up),
and choosing "text only with line breaks".
</p>
<p>
Go into PRTK. Choose Processing, then post-processing, then Misc.
Load the new file (bottom right of the screen), then check off the first two options: 
remove end of line spaces and change lines with only spaces to ^p. 
Run the program then exit PRTK. 
(Note: ^p is the end of paragraph or 'hard return' character in MS Word, your mileage may vary.)
</p>
<pre>
In your word processor do the following.
	a. Select everything from the beginning of the text to the end of the file.
	b. Change ^p^p to @@ in the selected area.
	c. Change ^p to space in the selected area.
	d. Change @@ to ^p^p in the selected area.
	e. You now have text that will fill to the margins with the spacing between paragraphs preserved
</pre>
<p>
Adjust the size of your page so that there are 65-75 characters in a fixed-width 10 pt font per line.
SAVE the file, choosing "text only with line breaks".
Search for two spaces together and change them to a single space.
</p>
<p>
While doing the above, you will find the indented material.
Delete the ** and insert a return, making sure that the overall formatting looks OK.
