<a name="1"><b>1. What is Distributed Proofreaders?</b></a><br><br>
This site is now an official <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">Project Gutenberg</a> site and your donations go to The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  This site uses a combination of PHP, mySQL and some Java Script to
create a 'library'. People scanning books (using scanners) can upload the scanned image files and the initial text file for 
the images that is produced by OCR software. <p>
When a proofer elects to proofread a page for a particular project, the text and image file are displayed on a single 
webpage. This allows the text file to be easily reviewed and compared to the image file, thus assisting the proofreading 
of the text file. The edited text file is then submitted back into the library. The basic concept is that several 
proofreaders can be working on the same book, but different pages, at the same time. This will significantly speed up 
the proofreading process. <p>
Once all pages for a particular book have been processed and the proofed work submitted back into the library, all the 
pieces can be joined, properly formatted and submitted to the PG archive by the project manager.
<br><br>

<a name="2"><b>2. What is Project Gutenberg?</b></a><br><br>
Michael Hart founded Project Gutenberg in 1971. His idea was: anything that can be entered into a computer can be 
reproduced indefinitely. This led to the concept of entering books into computers and sharing these books with the
world. <p>

These Electronic Texts (Etexts) would be made available in the simplest, easiest to use form. This means 
"Plain Vanilla ASCII." Italics, underlines, and bolds would be capitalized. In the same vein, the books selected 
would be those that appealed to the greatest number of people possible. Due to copyright laws, it is only legal 
to do this with older books (copyrighted 75 or more years ago). As a result, Project Gutenberg is mostly comprised
of the "Classics." <p>

You can read more about Project Gutenberg at: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/history.html">www.gutenberg.net/history.html</a>
<br><br>

<a name="3"><b>3. Why do we pick the books that we do?</b></a><br><br>
The Project Managers (mostly Charles) pick whatever books we can find. Due to US copyright laws, we are severely limited in the 
books we are allowed to work with. We go to Used & Rare bookshops and scour the Internet. We try to find books that we think people 
would enjoy reading and that we can find at an acceptable price. <p>

Before selecting a book to make an etext out of, we check <a href="http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html">David's In-Progress List</a>
to make certain that it has not already been done or is in progress by someone else.<p>

If you have a book that you would like to see done (and it is copyright cleared) contact one of the Project Managers or Charles.
<br><br>

<a name="4"><b>4. How can I help?</b></a><br><br>
The process of creating an etext is a long one. Distributed Proofreaders was set up so that you can help the Project Managers by proof reading
their books. If you have not already done so, click on the "Create" link and make an account. This enables you to
select an available book and proof read a few pages. Any work done is greatly appreciated and goes a long way toward
assisting us in creating etexts.<p>

If you really catch Gutenberg fever, you may want to become a Project Manager. If you think that being a Project Manager 
is for you, start by learning all you can about Project Gutenberg. Go to the main site <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">www.gutenberg.net</a> 
and read all you can. Subscribe to the mailing lists and listen in for a while. Proof read pages from several books 
so you can get the feel for the process. Try to find a source, or sources, for candidate books. Read the Project Manager's FAQ (forthcoming). 
When you feel ready, contact Charles. <p>

If you want to do more for the site, but don't have the time, or inclination, to become a Project Manager, you might consider
making a donation. Funding for the site comes entirely from Charles and the Project Managers (for the books they do). 
Please contact Charles if you wish to make a donation.

<p>
You can also donate Public Domain books by shipping them to us for scanning (better if they do not need to be returned). You can also scan the books and send us the images (best if you need to keep the book). We would prefer it if you would clear the books first with Project Gutenberg before scanning and sending us the images. Please refer to the <a href="pm-faq.html">Project Managers FAQ</a> for more details on clearing and scanning books.<p> 

A <a href="DPflow.html">Workflow Diagram</a> for the site shows the general flow of material into and out of the site.

<br><br>

<a name="5"><b>5. How do I handle ...? </b></a><br><br>
There are no set "Rules" enforced by Project Gutenberg, but in order to allow the distributed proofreading to work, we
have written up our own <a href="document.html">Document Guidelines</a>. Please reference these and any project
comments that a project manager may have provided. 
The main goal is to preserve as much formatting as possible while making the etext readable on a computer. If you are a new proofreader 
it can be helpful to start proofing 'second round' e-texts, this can help you 'learn the ropes' and give you an idea of the general techniques.
<p>

<a name="6"><b>6. How do I contact ...?</b></a><br><br>
You can email Charles at: <a href="mailto:charlz@lvcablemodem.com">Charles Franks</a><br>
Other Project Managers can be reached by clicking on their name on the Projects page. Each project has a link
to the Project Manager in charge of it.
<br><br>

<a name="7"><b>7. What is the entire process for creating an etext? </b></a><br><br>
Here's a blow by blow list of the steps taken by a Project Manager when creating an etext.<br><br>
<table border = "0" cellspacing = "0" width = "630"> 
<td width = "30" valign="top">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a. </td><td>Locate a candidate book checking against <a href="http://www.dprice48.freeserve.co.uk/GutIP.html">David's In-Progress List</a>.</td><tr>

<td width = "30" valign="top">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp f. </td><td>We then feed this text to other programs to fix the things left by the OCR programs (like chapter headings, paragraph indention, paragraph separation, etc).</td><tr>

<td width = "30" valign="top">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp k. </td><td>We check this proofed copy and fix anything left using programs designed to assist us.</td><tr>
<td width = "30" valign="top">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp l. </td><td>The final copy is sent back to Charles who checks it again and finally sends it to Gutenberg.</td><tr>
<td width = "30" valign="top">&nbsp&nbsp m. </td><td>Other Gutenberg volunteers check it again and add it to the library, notifying Charles when it becomes available.</td>

<p>
As you can see, a book follows a long road to become an etext. These steps are covered in more detail in the Project Manager's FAQ (forthcoming).

<br><br>

<a name="8"><b>8. How can I get copies of the etexts I've worked on?</b></a><br><br>
At the bottom of the front page, Charles provides links to all the etexts processed through the site. Bronze and 
Silver stars denote that the etext is still in progress and is not yet in the Gutenberg Library. Click on the <b>txt</b> 
link for a plain text copy or the <b>zip</b> link for a zip compressed copy of the text. Some etexts also have an HTML copy. These 
copies have been enhanced by turning them into a web page. This is commonly done to preserve the pictures in the original book. 
<br><br>

<a name="9"><b>9. How can I get copies of other Gutenberg etexts?</b></a><br><br>
You can go to the Project Gutenberg site <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">www.gutenberg.net</a> and get copies of any etext
in the library, including the ones done through Distributed Proofreaders.
<br><br>

<a name="10"><b>10. I think I messed something up (done something wrong), How can I fix it?</b></a><br><br>
Don't panic. We all make mistakes. If you think you made a mistake on the last few pages of a particular project, go back to 
the Project Page and click on the "My Recently Done" link for that project and you will be given a chance to re-visit the last 
5 pages you submitted for that project.
<p>
If you think you made a mistake elsewhere on a text or are not sure that you handled something correctly, 
email the Project Manager. Tell them the book you were doing, the page you were on and what you did. Feel free to leave 
short notes in the pages as you do them, just make certain to mark them with an asterisk so that we can find them.
