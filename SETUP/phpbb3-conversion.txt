PGDP's steps and experiences for converting phpBB2 to phpBB3 (3.0).

The following are the steps PGDP used when converting from phpBB2 to phpBB3.
They are included here in case it helps your own conversion.

=======================================================================
Install phpBB3 - 3.0
--------------------

These steps can be done without any site outage.

Note: Prior to the 08 release, the phpBB tables had to be in the same MySQL
database as the DP tables. The 08 release allows them to be in separate
databases as long as the same authentication information is used to access
them. This document assumes you want to move the tables to their own
database.

 1. Create a new DB for the phpBB3 tables:
      mysql -uroot -p$ROOT_PASSWORD -e \
        "create database $FORUMS_DB_NAME DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_bin;"
 2. Grant permissions to the new database using the same credentials as the DP
    database.
      mysql -uroot -p$ROOT_PASSWORD -e \
        "grant all on $FORUMS_DB_NAME.* to '$DP_USER'@'localhost';"
 3. Download the latest phpBB 3.0 code from https://www.phpbb.com/downloads/3.0/
 4. Extract the code into the web space.
 5. Change the permissions on specific directories to be owned, and thus
    writeable, by the webserver (you may need to change www-data to whatever
    is appropriate for your system, this is sometimes 'nobody'):
      cd phpBB3 && sudo chown -R www-data:www-data cache files store \
        config.php images/avatars/upload/ images/avatars/gallery/ \
        images/ranks/ images/smilies/
 6. Access the install directory from the web space.
 7. Install the forum code per the instructions using the $FORUMS_DB_NAME DB.
    The instructions below assume that the phpBB table prefix is the default
    'phpbb_'.
 8. After the install completes, access the Administration Control Panel
    to do any post-install and pre-conversion steps.
 9. (optional) Download and install additional language packs, styles and MODs.
10. (optional) Set the default style to the one you want users brought over
    from phpBB2 to use if their style isn't installed. (see below)


=======================================================================
Convert phpBB2 data
-------------------

These steps require that both the DP UI and the forum UI be offline.
The conversion process can take hours depending on how much data is in your
database and the speed of the server CPUs and I/O backend. At PGDP, this
part of the process took 4 hours.

 1. Disable the phpBB2 board to prevent data changing from underneath you.
 2. Set the DP code into maintenance mode.
 3. Access the install directory from the web space.
 4. Select the Convert tab at the top and follow the instructions
    to do the data conversion.
    The conversion will take a while and have many steps, be patient.


=======================================================================
Post installation / conversion steps
------------------------------------

These steps are done after the data conversion but before the site
is back online. At PGDP, this process took an hour.

 1. Disable the phpBB3 forum to do post-conversion/install changes
 2. Move the install/ directory out of the web space
 3. Update pinc/site_vars.php in the DP code to use phpBB version 3 by:
    * Setting PHPBB_VERSION to 3
    * Setting PHPBB_TABLE_PREFIX to $FORUMS_DB_NAME.phpbb
    * Updating $forums_dir and $forums_url
 4. (optional) Enable HTML in the Site Description (see below)
 5. Do post-install forum setting changes from the Administration
    Control Panel.
    1. (optional) Select the mysql fulltext search backend. phpBB3 supports
       both its native search engine as well as using mysql fulltext. PGDP
       discovered scale limitations with the native engine in phpBB3 and
       switched to mysql fulltext in the conversion. 
    2. Create the new search index. This can take minutes to hours depending
       on the backend, size of the forum, and the server. You can do other
       post-install steps in another window as this is proceeding.
    3. Disable new registrations. DP code must be the only thing creating
       user accounts. Allowing users to self-register with the forum will
       prevent those usernames from being used as DP accounts.
    4. Ensure the Site Description has no HTML (or valid HTML if you've
       installed the patch allowing it).
    5. Evaluate some of the new phpBB3 features which are on by default
       to see if you want to use them, of note:
       * Attachments (in posts and PMs)
       * Birthdays
       * Inclusion of Flash for posts, PMs, and signatures
       * Ability to send PMs to multiple users / groups
    6. Update forum descriptions to use BBcode if they were using HTML prior.
    7. Audit user permissions. PGDP discovered that forum permissions did
       not convert cleanly. Ensure the Registered Users and Guests user
       groups have the desired forum permissions. phpBB3 allows Bots to have
       read-only access to the forums. If this is not something you want,
       adjust the permissions of the Bot Access forum role and consider adding
       a robots.txt.
 6. (optional) Install Apache redirects for phpBB2 URLs to phpBB3 URLs
    (see below)
 7. (optional) Update/create any .htaccess controls for the phpBB3/adm directory.
 8. Move the old phpBB2 code out of the webspace.
 9. Clear all session data (from both DP and phpBB) to ensure users are correctly
    logged into both the DP code and the phpBB3 post-conversion.
10. (optional) If you are using MediaWiki, install the module to allow users
    to log into the wiki with their phpBB credentials (see below)
11. DP code does lookups on the phpbb_users.username column but the column
    doesn't come with an index. To enable fast lookups, add the following index:
       ALTER TABLE $FORUMS_DB_NAME.phpbb_users ADD INDEX username (username);
12. Enable the phpBB3 board.
13. Disable maintenance mode in the DP code.


=======================================================================
Post-conversion Follow-up
------------------------------------

These are steps to do after you're satisfied with the phpBB3 conversion.

 1. Backup and remove the phpBB2 tables.
 2. Remove the phpBB2 code that was moved out of the webspace.


=======================================================================
Optional steps
--------------

The instructions above refer to several optional steps. More information
about those are included here.


HTML in Site Description
------------------------
PGDP uses HTML in the Site Description for the board configuration to point
back to the Activity Hub, Wiki, and Blog. phpBB3 doesn't allow HTML in the
site description without a code change.

We patched phpBB3/includes/functions.php to allow HTML in the site
description. A patch file is included as phpbb3-functions.php.patch.

To use it, cd into the phpBB code directory and run:
  patch -p0 < path_to_SETUP/phpbb3-functions.php.patch


PM contents in email notification
---------------------------------
PGDP members like having a PM's contents in the email notification from the
forum. For phpBB 3.0, the Prime Notify extention does this. For phpBB 3.2,
we patch phpBB3/phpbb/notification/types/pm.php using phpbb32-pm.php.patch.

To use it, cd into the phpBB code directory and run:
  patch -p0 < path_to_SETUP/phpbb32-pm.php.patch


Default style
-------------
The default phpBB3 style is "prosilver". The "subsilver2" style is included
in the base phpBB3 and more closely resembles the default phpBB2 theme. 
PGDP decided to make subsilver2 the default theme to help minimize the
visual differences from the forum conversion.

Setting a default theme *before* the conversion ensures that all converted
users (as well as any new users after the conversion) get the theme by default.


Apache URL redirects
--------------------
At PGDP, the base forum URL changed from http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2 to
http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3. We installed redirects for some common URLs
that people may have bookmarked to ease the conversion. These were
placed in httpd.conf.

 # phpBB2 to phpBB3 redirect
 # Explicitly allow links to forums, topics, posts to be redirected to their
 # new locations in phpBB3. Redirect everything else to the base phpBB3 path.
 RedirectMatch permanent ^/phpBB2/(viewtopic.php.*)$ http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/$1
 RedirectMatch permanent ^/phpBB2/(viewforum.php.*)$ http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3/$1
 RedirectMatch temp ^/phpBB2 http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB3


MediaWiki authentication
------------------------
If you are using MediaWiki, install the MediaWiki_PHPBB_Auth extension to
allow users to log into the wiki with their phpBB credentials.

See: https://github.com/Digitalroot/MediaWiki_PHPBB_Auth/tree/v3.0.3

WARNING: If you are upgrading from phpBB 2.x, you must patch the extension
after installing it! The extension for phpBB 2.x created MediaWiki usernames
that matched the capitalization of those from phpBB. The extension for
phpBB 3.0 uses the new username_clean column which, among other things,
lowercases the phpBB usernames in the wiki. Without the patch, users with
capital letters in their names will get a new wiki account differing only
in capitalization upon log-in. Apply the included MediaWiki_PHPBB_Auth.patch
to the extensions/ subdirectory after installing the extension.
